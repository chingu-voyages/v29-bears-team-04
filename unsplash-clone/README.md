# Tasks

-   [ ] consider/add general sub-components folder : possible name 'partials'
-   [ ] figure out if @types in package.json need to be there or in "dev dependencies"
-   [ ] consider/delete/remove the testing files and packages

## Possible File Structure

If we end up using React-Router... how do we feel about making a new directory for each route and then importing the finished route into App.tsx. The directory can contain route specific stylesheets and sub-components. This way each folder would contain all related html and css.

The utils folder can be used for any global functions and possibly hooks.
